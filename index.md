Within this initiative, supported by Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway through the [EEA Grants and Norwegian Grants](https://www.eeagrants.sk/en/), the [Technical University of Ko≈°ice](https://tuke.sk/) (TUKE) Slovakia, and the [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/english/) (UiO) Norway, are collaborating to enhance and innovate the teaching of courses focused on theoretical computer science, using modern approaches and tools.

One of the main goals is the planned development of an interactive teaching tool through which users can study the fundamental principles of deduction and manipulation with proofs as programs. During in-person and regular online meetings, members of the research team will share their long-term experience in teaching courses related to logic, type theory, and semantics of programming languages.

Among the other objectives of the initiative are cooperation in the development of new teaching materials for both parties, research in the field of proof assistants' development, with a focus on precise visualization of the proof process emulation and its use in teaching, as well as the possibilities of gamification of the teaching process. The results obtained from the initiative will be implemented in the teaching process, and innovative research findings will be presented at international scientific conferences.
