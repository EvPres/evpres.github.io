Within this initiative, supported by Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway through the [EEA Grants and Norwegian Grants](https://www.eeagrants.sk/en/), the [Technical University of Ko≈°ice](https://tuke.sk/) (TUKE) Slovakia, and the [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/english/) (UiO) Norway, are collaborating to enhance the teaching of subjects focused on theoretical computer science, using modern approaches and tools.

As part of this initiative's solution, there are plans to develop a teaching tool that allows students to study the fundamental principles of manipulating proofs as programs. Both TUKE and UiO will exchange their expertise in teaching logic, type theory, and semantics of programming languages. Collaboration is also anticipated in creating new teaching materials for both institutions. The main outcome will be the development of an interactive teaching tool and the integration of these results into the teaching process.
