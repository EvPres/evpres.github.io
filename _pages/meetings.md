The team members met at the Technical University in Košice

We have addressed the initially proposed outcomes of the initiative. They are

- Lecture notes for the course "*Programming Language Implementation and Formalisation*" (UiO).
- Lecture notes for the course "*Logic for informaticians*" (TUKE).
- A digital tool `onlineprover.com` to use for providing and solving
   exercises in natural deduction (Gentzen style).
- A survey paper that analyzes the state-of-the-art for such tools.
- A user interface for interacting with the tool in a browser.
- A collection of teaching scenarios that we want to try out in future work.

There was a discussion about approaches to teaching relevant subjects, which gave rise to ideas on how to improve the teaching process on both sides. The possibilities of how to implement the proposed improvements into the teaching process were discussed. The software requirements of the proposed teaching tool were developed.

We have developed informal semantics for a second iteration of the
prototype DSL language, which is going to be more like a Lex/Yacc
implementation with a special notion of pattern matching. We have also discussed the user interface, and came up with a new design.

Additionally, the team members from UiO have given three guest lectures in master courses.

- Michael Kirkedal Thomsen : **Reversible quantum computing** (*Semantics of programming languages*).
- Joachim Tilsted Kristensen: **Continuation passing style** (Functional programming).
- Joachim Tilsted Kristensen: **Proofs as programs** (Type theory).

## 1st meeting - 14.10.2023 - 20.10.2023

Team members met at the University of Oslo and started to work on the solution to the proposed initiative results. We have engaged in discussions about each other's approaches to teaching relevant courses, proposed ideas on how to improve the teaching process on both sides, and possibilities of how to implement proposed improvements into it. We have also discussed the proposed teaching tool's requirements and created the software requirements that shall be implemented. 

Achievements: 

-   Planning, team setup, initial research, and analysis of the current state. 
-   Analysis of the current state in the area, similar tools, etc. 
-   Requirements gathering.
-   Design and functional specification of a teaching tool.
-   User Interface design.
-   Architecture design.
-   Technologies.
-   Initial prototype.
