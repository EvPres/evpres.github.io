## July 2025 - Our research is reaching new heights — literally!
 <img src="/images/EMA1.jpg"/>

As part of our ongoing experimental work, we performed a preliminary modal analysis using impact excitation from a dropped metal ball at Technical University of Košice's lab. This simple yet effective method helps us observe the dynamic response of the structure and extract its natural frequencies and mode shapes.

Big thanks to our colleague for going the extra (ladder) step to get the job done safely and accurately!

## July 2025 - IAESTE intern

For 8 weeks, from mid-May to mid-July, our team had the pleasure of welcoming an IAESTE intern at Technical University of Košice as part of our ongoing international collaboration efforts.

We were happy to host John Witczak, who contributed significantly to the development of Python code for our prestress loss database — an important part of our work in structural analysis and research.

We’d like to sincerely thank John for his tremendous help, dedication, and great energy throughout his stay. Wishing him all the best in his future endeavors!

## July 2025 - Material Properties Testing

At the 28-day mark, the EVPRES team conducted a series of material characterization tests to evaluate the performance of our concrete samples.

One of the key procedures was modulus of elasticity testing. This test helps determine how concrete deforms under load — a critical parameter for both numerical simulations and modal analysis, where material stiffness directly influences dynamic response.

Accurate determination of these values ensures the reliability of our theoretical models and the validity of our experimental investigations.

## July 2025 - Workshop on Data-Driven Intelligent Assessment of Bridge Infrastructure held at TUKE

We’re happy to share that our recent research was presented at the workshop "Data-Driven Intelligent Assessment of Bridge Infrastructure" by Patrícia Vaňová, organized at Technical University of Košice!

## July 2025 - EVACES Conference

While waiting for our girders to arrive, we’ve been keeping busy with exciting research! 

Using data from a previous study, we explored the potential of sparse autoencoders — a type of neural network designed to learn efficient, compressed representations — for damage detection in a model steel truss bridge.

We're proud to see how insights from one research can inform and inspire progress in another.

## June 2025 - Prestressed Concrete Girders Delivered

Just a few days after casting, our two prestressed concrete girders have been successfully delivered to our laboratory at Technical University of Košice!

This brings us one step closer to the experimental phase of our research. We’re excited to begin preparations for testing and to gather valuable data for structural health monitoring and analysis.

## June 2025 - Milestone Achieved: Prestressed Concrete Girders Successfully Cast
 <img src="/images/prefa.jpg"/>

We’re excited to share a major achievement in our ongoing research project — the successful casting of our prestressed concrete girders.

This is a huge step forward in our research and development efforts, and we're thrilled to see everything coming together. The team’s hard work and coordination are paying off, and we’re looking forward to the next phases of testing and analysis. 

Stay tuned for more updates!

## November 2024 - Workshop on Data-Driven Intelligent Assessment of Bridge Infrastructure
 <img src="/images/china.jpg"/>

Last week, four members of our research team had the pleasure of attending a workshop on "Data-Driven Intelligent Assessment of Bridge Infrastructure," part of a bilateral project supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under project no. SK-CN-23-0037. Organized by Professor Zhen Sun and hosted by the School of Civil Engineering at Southeast University in China, the workshop gathered experts to discuss structural health monitoring (SHM) of girder bridges using real-time data and the current conditions of bridges in China and Slovakia. The program also included a tour of the Structural Laboratory at Southeast University.

During the workshop, our team presented the newly funded project, "Evaluation of Prestressing Forces in Prestressed Concrete Bridges" (EvPres). We also had the opportunity to visit the Data Center for Long-Span Bridges in Jiangsu, and explore the monitoring of local infrastructure, including a prestressed concrete bridge and the Nanjing Dashengguan Yangtze River Bridge, where we observed the installation of monitoring sensors inside the structure.

This workshop provided an excellent platform for sharing knowledge, exchanging ideas, and identifying possibilities for future collaboration. We extend our gratitude to everyone involved in organizing and participating in this event!

## October 2024 - Website Launched

We are excited to announce the official launch of our website! This platform will be the main hub for updates, news, and resources related to our project. Stay tuned for the latest developments!

## September 2024 - Project Kickoff

The project officially started on September 1st, and we’re thrilled to begin this journey. Our team is hard at work setting the foundation for the goals outlined in our project objectives.
