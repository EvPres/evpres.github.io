 <img src="/images/china.png"/>

Last week, four members of our research team had the pleasure of attending a workshop on "Data-Driven Intelligent Assessment of Bridge Infrastructure," part of a bilateral project supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under project no. SK-CN-23-0037. Organized by Professor Zhen Sun and hosted by the School of Civil Engineering at Southeast University in China, the workshop gathered experts to discuss structural health monitoring (SHM) of girder bridges using real-time data and the current conditions of bridges in China and Slovakia. The program also included a tour of the Structural Laboratory at Southeast University.

During the workshop, our team presented the newly funded project, "Evaluation of Prestressing Forces in Prestressed Concrete Bridges" (EvPres). We also had the opportunity to visit the Data Center for Long-Span Bridges in Jiangsu, and explore the monitoring of local infrastructure, including a prestressed concrete bridge and the Nanjing Dashengguan Yangtze River Bridge, where we observed the installation of monitoring sensors inside the structure.

This workshop provided an excellent platform for sharing knowledge, exchanging ideas, and identifying possibilities for future collaboration. We extend our gratitude to everyone involved in organizing and participating in this event!
