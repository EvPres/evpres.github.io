## Interactive Proof System

The main goal of the project is to develop a web application: an *interactive proof system* and deploy it in the teaching of relevant courses at TUKE and UiO.
- In preparation.
- Plan for the first prototype - February 2024.

## Survey Article

An important aspect of any research project is a thorough analysis of the current state. For this reason, we will prepare an survey article on the use of educational web applications in the teaching of formal methods.
- In preparation.
- Plan: summer 2024.

## Lecture notes

Another output of the project is the creation or update of teaching materials (lecture notes) for the respective courses in which the developed web tool will be used.

- **Implementation and Formalization of Programming Languages** (UiO)
  - [Course Information Page](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN5630/index.html)
  - In preparation.

- **Logic for Computer Scientists** (TUKE)
  - [Course Information Page and Current Version of Lecture notes (*Only in Slovak*)](https://kurzy.kpi.fei.tuke.sk/lpi/)
  - In the finalization process.

## Conference/Workshop

The research results conducted during the development of the web-based teaching tool and its subsequent implementation into teaching are planned to be published at relevant scientific conferences or workshops.

Plan: summer 2024.
