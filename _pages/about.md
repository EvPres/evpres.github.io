The goal of the EvPres project is to develop a monitoring methodology that will allow for precise quantification of prestressing forces in prestressed concrete bridges. The results of this project will significantly contribute to evaluating the technical condition of bridges across Europe, helping to prevent their sudden failure or premature closure. EvPres thus represents a key step toward enhancing the safety and efficient use of prestressed concrete bridges across Europe.

Three main research gaps (RGs) have been identified in the state-of-the-art of quantifying prestressing forces in prestressed concrete bridges:

- **RG1**: The lack of advanced numerical models/digital twins of prestressed concrete beams and prestressed concrete bridges.
- **RG2**: The insufficient methodologies developed so far for SHM of quantifying the prestressed forces in prestressed concrete bridges.
- **RG3**: The lack of unified methodology for determining prestressing forces in prestressed concrete bridges.
